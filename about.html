    <h1>HELIOS PROJECT</h1>
    <h2> Welcome,Navigator! <br> Here's your mission debrief!</h2>
    <p class="div2" style="position:absolute;left:40%;top:4%;transform:-50%,-50%;">Long story short, due to reasons we can't yet understand, the sun of our solar system is expanding extremely fast. As the Navigator, Your mission is to navigate spaceships each carrying a mini human biobank to survive through the deep space, away from the sun, until a new home is found for future humans.</div>
    <p class="div2" style="position:absolute;left:50%;top:20%;transform:-50%,-50%;">Helios, the spaceship will be with you till the end. You can use <u>AWSD</u> key to control the ship. You can read you travel time, speed, and distance to sun's surface in real time. The ship has a self-repairing shield system, but the repairing process takes time, so be careful.</div>
    <p class="div2" style="position:absolute;left:60%;top:36%;transform:-50%,-50%;">By pressing <u>space</u> bar, you can activate the mini Dyson Ring on the ship and colloect the solar power near by, with which we can accelarate and reinforce our shield. Please notice, The process will slow down the ship, so be as quick as possible.</div>
    <p class="div2" style="position:absolute;left:60%;top:52%;transform:-50%,-50%;">On the journey, you will encounter many of these obstacles in different sizes and shapes. Don't worry, the shield will protect you, but please still try to avoid them for safety.</div>
    <p class="div2" style="position:absolute;left:50%;top:68%;transform:-50%,-50%;">We observed some unusual dark trails in the deep space, we think it results from lightspeed abnormal, which is caused by interstellar transport technologies we can't yet achieve. We don't know what it does. Try avoiding them too if you can.</div>
    <P class="div2" style="position:absolute;left:40%;top:84%;transform:-50%,-50%;">A wormhole can be a great opportunity for you to jump a long distance in a short time, but it'll damage our shield and we don't know where they'll take you, so make a wise decision when you see one.</div>
